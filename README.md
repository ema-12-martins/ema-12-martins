# Hi 👋

Hi, my name is Ema, and I am currently in the first year of my Master's in Informatics and Computing Engineering at FEUP. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering from the University of Minho, as well as a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from the same university. I am a member of Literanua, a university musical group (Tuna). I love reading and swimming. I am seeking summer internships to enhance my skills and gain professional experience.
